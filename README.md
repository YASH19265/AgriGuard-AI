# 🌱 AgriGuard AI

👋 Hi, I'm Yash! Welcome to my project, AgriGuard AI.

## 👨‍🌾 Why I Built This
I wanted to create something that actually makes a difference in the real world. AgriGuard AI is a platform designed to help farmers monitor their fields, track crop cultivation, and detect issues like harmful bacteria before they spread. The goal is to bring data-driven agriculture straight to the people who grow our food.

## 💻 My Coding Journey
I started my coding journey just over six months ago, and building this has been a huge milestone for me! As a first-year BCA student, my ultimate goal is to become a full-stack developer so I can build complete, complex websites entirely on my own and compete in hackathons. Getting this project live is a big step in that direction.

## 🛠️ What I Used
For this frontend of the site, I focused on building a solid, responsive foundation:
* **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
* Deployed live via **Netlify**

*(Note: I am actively learning and working with Python, Java, DSA, and MongoDB to eventually build out the backend logic and full AI capabilities!)*
